# Social Justice Prework

The purpose of our social justice pre-work is to enter Ada with some shared learning about creating equitable and self-aware community here. We’ll explore questions like: who are we? What is the “water we swim in” and how have we been impacted by it? How do we take care of self and our communities?

Please interact with this content in a way that honors your own identity and needs. All your reflections or journaling are personal, and you will not be asked to submit any work or responses in relation to this content. Open the attached PDF for a more in-depth introduction to this material and to get started.
