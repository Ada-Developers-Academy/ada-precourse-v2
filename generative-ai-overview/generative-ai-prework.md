# Generative AI Prework

The goal of the Generative AI pre-readings is to start Adies off with a common base of information around Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Generative AIs they power, as well as to prepare you for an in-class activity where we will discuss our takeaways and understanding of these readings.

We will be introducing topics around Generative AI and showcasing some tools and techniques for working with them throughout the coursework, so we want to create a shared understanding of generally what an LLM is and how it operates. We acknowledge that students may have different levels of experience and interest with these topics before starting at Ada. Some folks may find it helpful to skim through the materials while others may want to do a couple close readings. 

## Questions for Reflection

However you choose to move through the materials, as you read through these resources, try to reflect on the following questions for our in-person discussion:
1. Given a text prompt, how do LLMs like chatGPT try to create a response? 
    * How does this differ from how people create responses when asked a question?
2. How does the data a LLM was trained on affect the responses that they create? 
    * What kinds of impacts can that have when the responses are used to make decisions?
3. What kinds of tasks are LLMs good at performing? What kinds of tasks do they struggle with?Â 
4. What are a few considerations for using AI tools responsibly?
5. What are some technical or physical limitations of LLMs?
    * What are they able to process? What equipment or infrastructure does it take to keep an LLM running?
