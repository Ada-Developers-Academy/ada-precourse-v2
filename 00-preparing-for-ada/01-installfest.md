## A Tale of 2 Macs

This lesson has 2 main sections, one for Intel-based Macs and one for Apple Silicon Macs.  In late 2020, Apple released a new type of Macbook using an ARM-based chip designed in-house called the M1.  Prior to this Apple had used Intel x86 CPUs.  

Computers with M1 CPUs are great!  However... as they are new, not all developer tools have been written to work with the new chipset.  For the most part M1 Macs will be fine for work at ADA.  However you may encounter some issues regarding libraries not tuned for the M1.  That's often the price for living on the cutting-edge!
