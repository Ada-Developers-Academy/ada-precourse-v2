# Precourse Live

## Intro

Precourse Live is 5 instructor lead sessions to review and practice the precourse material. Whether or not you attend Precourse Live, you may find it helpful to review the resources from the sessions, including slides, replit exercises, and recordings.

## Resources
At Ada, we use a variety of tools to communicate. This means that resources for classroom activities can live on different platforms.
